The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC)

is an open source middleware system for volunteer and grid computing. It was
originally developed to support the SETI@home project before it became useful
as a platform for other distributed applications in areas as diverse as
mathematics, medicine, molecular biology, climatology, and astrophysics. The
intent of BOINC is to make it possible for researchers to tap into the 
enormous processing power of personal computers around the world.

Use the idle time on your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux) to cure diseases,
study global warming, discover pulsars, and do many other types of scientific
research. It's safe, secure, and easy.

After installation you need to join a BOINC project:
  http://boinc.berkeley.edu/projects.php

To start BOINC create a directory for BOINC to use, navigate to that directory
and run:
   boinc_client -help

This will print out all the usage commands for running BOINC.

Furthermore:
  On your project website, once logged in, you can tell the project server
how it should use your computer (under computing preferences on your profile).

I suggest you use a temperature monitoring program while running BOINC.
